                    Tuna News brings you an inspiring story from our community. Earlier this week, a new public square
                    was officially dedicated in honor of Dr. José Maria Costa, a prominent figure known for his
                    contributions to local education and cultural preservation.

                <p>
                    The Dr. José Maria Costa Square, located at the heart of Tuna city center, was unveiled during a
                    ceremony attended by local officials, friends, and family members of the esteemed doctor. The square
                    features a decorative plaque with Dr. Costa’s image and a plaque that reads: "In Grateful Memory of
                    Dr. José Maria Costa – A Life Dedicated to Our Community."

                <h1>The Timeless Tune of Tuna: Portugal's Fishermen Keep Tradition Alive</h1>
                <h2>Catch and Culture: Tuna Fishing in Modern Portugal</h2>

                <img src="/images/The Timeless Tune of Tuna.webp" alt="Illustrative image" width="400px" />

                <p>
                    In the heart of Portugal’s rugged coast, where the Atlantic meets the land, a legacy as old as the
                    sea itself continues to thrive. The small, picturesque fishing villages along the Alentejo and
                    Setúbal coasts are home to a tradition that has defined the region for centuries: the art of tuna
                    fishing. Today, however, this tradition is evolving, not just in how it’s practiced, but in its very
                    essence.
                </p>
                <h3>A Tradition Born from the Depths</h3>
                <p>
                    The story of tuna fishing in Portugal is as much a part of the nation’s cultural identity as its
                    iconic architecture or cuisine. For generations, local fishermen have relied on their expertise to
                    harvest these majestic fish, working closely with the rhythms of the ocean and the needs of their
                    families. Tuna was once a staple in Portuguese diets, used for everything from sustenance to
                    celebration.

                <h1>The Big Catch: Local Fishermen Reel in Record Tuna</h1>
                <h2>The Big Catch: Record Tuna Spawn Surprise in Porto Moniz</h2>

                <img src="/images/The Big Catch.webp" alt="Illustrative image" width="400px" />

                <p>
                    In an exciting turn of events, the tiny coastal village of Porto Moniz has recently made headlines
                    for an unusual reason—record-sized tuna have been spotted off its shores. This unexpected twist has
                    not only brought joy to the faces of local fishermen but also sparked curiosity among marine
                    enthusiasts across Portugal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tuna fishing in Porto Moniz is a tradition that dates back centuries, with the region's waters known
                    for their rich biodiversity and prime conditions for the elusive bluefin tuna. Recently, however,
                    the village has witnessed something extraordinary: a series of massive tuna have been caught near
                    the coast, with some weighing over 1,000 pounds each. Experts say this is part of a natural cycle
                    but still an impressive feat for such a small community.
