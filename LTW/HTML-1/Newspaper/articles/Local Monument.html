                    Tuna News brings you an inspiring story from our community. Earlier this week, a new public square
                    was officially dedicated in honor of Dr. Jos√© Maria Costa, a prominent figure known for his
                    contributions to local education and cultural preservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dr. Jos√© Maria Costa Square, located at the heart of Tuna city center, was unveiled during a
                    ceremony attended by local officials, friends, and family members of the esteemed doctor. The square
                    features a decorative plaque with Dr. Costa‚Äôs image and a plaque that reads: "In Grateful Memory of
                    Dr. Jos√© Maria Costa ‚Äì A Life Dedicated to Our Community."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking at the event, Mayor Pedro Martins praised Dr. Costa‚Äôs legacy. ‚ÄúDr. Costa was not just a
                    teacher; he was a pillar of our community. His work has left an indelible mark on Tuna‚Äôs history,‚Äù
                    stated Martins. He added, ‚ÄúThis square is more than just a physical space‚Äîit‚Äôs a testament to his
                    enduring impact.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    A local resident, Maria Oliveira, shared her feelings about the new plaza. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wonderful to have a
                    place where everyone can come together and remember someone who did so much for us,‚Äù she said. Many
                    attendees also expressed their support on social media, with hashtags like #TunaProud and
                    #GratitudeForDrCosta trending.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ceremony concluded with a performance by the Tuna Philharmonic Orchestra, which played
                    traditional songs that Dr. Costa had frequently conducted in his career. The event was attended by
                    approximately 500 people, with many taking selfies in front of the plaque to mark the occasion.
